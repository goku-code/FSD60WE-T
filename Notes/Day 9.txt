Every element in html is considered as box.

The Box Model: The Foundation of Web Layouts

The box model is the fundamental concept governing how HTML elements are rendered on a web page. It serves as a mental framework for understanding the total space an element occupies, encompassing its content, padding, border, and margin.

Content Box: This is the core area where the element's actual content, like text or an image, resides. Its dimensions are defined by the width and height properties in CSS.

Padding: Padding adds a customizable layer of space around the content box. It creates a buffer between the content and the element's borders, providing visual separation and potentially room for hover effects or subtle animations. Padding can be specified for all sides individually or as a uniform value.

Border: The border acts as a visual delineation of the element, separating it from the surrounding content. It's defined by properties like border-style (solid, dashed, dotted), border-width, and border-color. A well-defined border enhances readability and can establish visual hierarchy.

Margin default value:16
we cant use the space part if we use margin.We can use space if we use margin left or right top bottom.
Margin: Margin defines the outer edge of the element, encompassing all the previous components (content, padding, and border). It creates spacing between the element and its neighbors, influencing the overall layout and visual flow of the page. Margins can be set individually or as a whole for a more streamlined approach.

top,right,bottom,left:comes outside of margin

position-relative:stays in the flow
position-absolute:oustside of the flow .
position-sticky:once it reaches the top it will be sticky.

we can change the postion using the top,right,bottom,left.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration at the beginning of an HTML document might seem like a formality, but it actually serves several important purposes:

Standards Mode Activation: It instructs the web browser to render the page in "standards mode." This ensures consistent behavior and adherence to the latest specifications defined for HTML. Without the doctype, browsers may fall back to older, less predictable rendering modes, potentially leading to layout issues and inconsistencies.

Validation and Tools: The doctype declaration acts as a reference point for validation tools. These tools help developers identify and fix errors in their HTML code, ensuring the page adheres to the chosen standard. A proper doctype allows these tools to function correctly.

Future-Proofing: While modern browsers might render pages decently without a doctype, new features and standards might rely on it in the future. Including the doctype declaration ensures your code is adaptable and ready for potential changes in how browsers interpret HTML.
